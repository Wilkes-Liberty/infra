# GitHub Actions CI/CD Strategy

This document outlines the GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline for Wilkes Liberty infrastructure, supporting automated deployments to development, staging, and production environments.

## Strategy Overview

### Branch-Based Deployment Model
Your approach is **excellent** and follows industry best practices:

```
Feature Branches → development → staging → master
      ↓              ↓           ↓         ↓
  Pull Request    Auto Deploy  Auto Deploy Manual Approval
  Code Review    to Dev Env   to Staging   + Blue/Green Production
```

### Why This Strategy Works Well

✅ **Clear progression path** from development to production  
✅ **Automated testing** at each stage prevents issues from advancing  
✅ **Manual approval gate** for production provides safety  
✅ **GitHub native** - no external CI/CD tools needed  
✅ **Cost effective** - GitHub Actions included with repository  
✅ **Excellent observability** - integrated with GitHub interface  

## Deployment Triggers

### Development Environment
**Trigger**: Push to `development` branch
**Purpose**: Rapid development iteration and feature testing

**Workflow**: `deploy-development.yml`
- Unit tests and linting
- Basic smoke tests  
- Fast deployment for quick feedback
- Slack notifications to development team

### Staging Environment  
**Trigger**: Push to `staging` branch (via merge from development)
**Purpose**: Production-like validation and comprehensive testing

**Workflow**: `deploy-staging.yml`
- Full test suite (unit + integration)
- Security scanning
- Performance testing
- Infrastructure deployment with Terraform
- Comprehensive health checks
- Deployment report generation

### Production Environment
**Trigger**: Push to `master` branch (via merge from staging) + manual approval
**Purpose**: Safe, monitored production deployment

**Workflow**: `deploy-production.yml`
- Manual approval gate (GitHub Environments)
- Pre-deployment validation (staging health check)
- Database backup before deployment
- Blue/green deployment strategy
- Extensive health checks with retries
- Automatic rollback capability
- Detailed reporting and alerting

## GitHub Actions Advantages

### ✅ **Native Integration**
- Seamlessly integrated with GitHub repository
- No additional tools or services required
- Built-in secret management with GitHub Secrets
- Environment protection rules and approvals

### ✅ **Cost Effectiveness**
- 2,000 free minutes per month for private repositories
- 50,000 free minutes for public repositories
- Pay-as-you-go pricing for additional usage
- No monthly subscription fees

### ✅ **Developer Experience**
- Familiar GitHub interface
- Rich marketplace of pre-built actions
- Matrix builds for testing multiple configurations
- Excellent debugging with workflow logs

### ✅ **Security Features**
- Encrypted secrets management
- Environment-specific secrets and protection rules
- Required reviewers for production deployments
- Audit logs for all deployments

## Required GitHub Secrets

### Repository Secrets (All Environments)
```
SOPS_AGE_KEY                    # AGE private key for SOPS decryption
SLACK_WEBHOOK                   # Slack webhook URL for notifications
PROTON_DKIM1_TARGET            # Proton Mail DKIM keys
PROTON_DKIM2_TARGET
PROTON_DKIM3_TARGET
```

### Environment-Specific Secrets
```
# Development Environment
DEV_NJALLA_API_TOKEN           # Njalla API token for dev DNS

# Staging Environment  
STAGING_NJALLA_API_TOKEN       # Njalla API token for staging DNS

# Production Environment
PRODUCTION_NJALLA_API_TOKEN    # Njalla API token for production DNS
```

## Environment Protection Rules

### Development Environment
- No protection rules (fast iteration)
- All team members can deploy
- Automatic deployment on push

### Staging Environment
- Require status checks to pass
- Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
- Automatic deployment after checks pass

### Production Environment
- **Required reviewers**: Infrastructure team leads
- **Manual approval**: Required before deployment
- **Restrict pushes**: Only designated team members can merge to master
- **Status checks**: All staging tests must pass

## Workflow Features

### Development Workflow
- **Fast feedback**: Minimal testing for rapid iteration
- **Basic validation**: Unit tests and linting only
- **Quick deployment**: Direct to development environment
- **Developer notifications**: Slack updates to development channel

### Staging Workflow
- **Comprehensive testing**: Full test suite including integration tests
- **Security scanning**: Automated security vulnerability checks
- **Performance testing**: Basic performance validation
- **Infrastructure updates**: Terraform deployment to staging
- **Detailed reporting**: Complete deployment report with test results

### Production Workflow
- **Safety gates**: Multiple validation layers
- **Pre-deployment checks**: Staging environment health validation
- **Backup strategy**: Automatic database backup before deployment
- **Blue/green deployment**: Zero-downtime deployment strategy
- **Health monitoring**: Extensive post-deployment health checks
- **Rollback capability**: Automatic rollback on health check failures
- **Comprehensive alerting**: Success/failure notifications to multiple channels

## Comparison with Alternatives

- Configure environment protection rules
- Set up environment-specific secrets
- Test complete pipeline flow

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
