# Multi-Environment Strategy

This document outlines the planned progression from single production environment to a comprehensive multi-environment infrastructure supporting development, staging, and production workflows.

## Environment Strategy Overview

### Current State: Production Focus
- **Status**: Single production environment using root-level Terraform files
- **Rationale**: Get production working and stable before adding complexity
- **Benefits**: Simple state management, rapid iteration, cost control

### Future State: Three-Environment Pipeline
```
Development ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production
     ‚Üì           ‚Üì         ‚Üì
   Feature    Full Stack  Blue/Green
   Testing    Validation   Deployment
```

## Infrastructure Considerations

### Network Architecture
```
Production:  10.10.0.0/24  (current)
Staging:     10.10.0.0/24  (isolated network, same IPs)
Development: 10.20.0.0/24  (different network range)
```

### DNS Strategy
```
Production:  *.wilkesliberty.com
Staging:     *.staging.wilkesliberty.com  
Development: *.dev.wilkesliberty.com
```

### Security Model
- **Production**: Full security hardening, strict access controls
- **Staging**: Production security model, network-isolated
- **Development**: Relaxed security for debugging, developer access

### Monitoring Strategy
- **Production**: Full monitoring, alerting, and observability
- **Staging**: Full monitoring for validation, shorter retention
- **Development**: Basic monitoring, minimal alerting

### Backup Strategy
- **Production**: Daily backups, 30+ day retention, offsite storage
- **Staging**: Daily backups, 7-14 day retention
- **Development**: Minimal backups, 1-3 day retention

## Cost Management

### Resource Optimization
- **Development**: Smaller instances, shared services, scheduled shutdowns
- **Staging**: Right-sized for testing, shutdown during off-hours
- **Production**: Appropriately sized for performance requirements

### Monitoring and Alerts
- Set up cost monitoring across all environments
- Alert on unexpected resource usage
- Regular cost review and optimization

## Deployment Pipeline

### Git Workflow and CI/CD Pipeline

#### Branch Strategy
```
Feature Branches ‚Üí development ‚Üí staging ‚Üí master (main)
        ‚Üì              ‚Üì          ‚Üì         ‚Üì
   Pull Request    Auto Deploy  Auto Deploy Manual Deploy
   Unit Tests     to Dev Env   to Staging   to Production
```

#### GitHub Actions Triggers
- **Development Environment**: Push to `development` branch
- **Staging Environment**: Merge `development` ‚Üí `staging` branch  
- **Production Environment**: Merge `staging` ‚Üí `master` branch (with manual approval)

### Deployment Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

#### Development Pipeline
**Trigger**: `push` to `development` branch
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [development]
```

3. Run basic smoke tests
4. Notify team of deployment status

#### Staging Pipeline  
**Trigger**: `push` to `staging` branch (from dev merge)
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [staging]
```
**Actions**:
1. Run full test suite
2. Deploy to staging environment
3. Run integration tests
4. Performance testing
5. Security scanning
6. Generate deployment report

#### Production Pipeline
**Trigger**: `push` to `master` branch (from staging merge) + manual approval
```yaml

  push:
    branches: [master]
environment:
  name: production
  approval_required: true
```
**Actions**:
1. Manual approval gate

## Migration Execution

### When Ready to Migrate
1. **Validate prerequisites**: Ensure production is stable and staging/dev servers are available
2. **Run dry-run**: `./scripts/migrate-to-multi-env.sh --dry-run`
3. **Execute migration**: `./scripts/migrate-to-multi-env.sh`
4. **Configure environments**: Update variables for staging and development
5. **Test deployments**: Validate each environment independently
6. **Set up pipelines**: Implement CI/CD automation
7. **Document procedures**: Update operational documentation

### Rollback Plan
- Complete backup created by migration script
- Restore from `backup-[timestamp]/` directory if needed
- Production environment unaffected during migration
